								<dt class="" id="service4"><i class="fa fa-check"></i>What is laser vision correction?</dt>
								<dd style="display: none;">
									<div class="row">
										<p style="padding: 0 10px 0 10px; text-align:justify;">Laser vision correction is a procedure that improves vision by permanently changing the shape of the cornea (the clear covering of the eye) with laser. This is often referred to as Lasek or Lasik. It is the most commonly performed type of laser procedure and an effective treatment for a wide range of vision problems.</p>			
									</div>
								</dd>
								<dt class="" id="service4"><i class="fa fa-check"></i>What is laser?</dt>
								<dd style="display: none;">
									<div class="row">
										<p style="padding: 0 10px 0 10px; text-align:justify;">A laser is a technology that utilizes ultraviolet light to precisely reshape the inner layers of the cornea. The reshaping is capable of correcting nearsighted, farsighted and astigmatism conditions using the custom vue procedure.</p>			
									</div>
								</dd>
								<dt id="service6"><i class="fa fa-check"></i>How does the laser know what to correct in my eyes?</dt>
								<dd style="display: none;">
									<div class="row">
										<p style="padding: 0 10px 0 10px; text-align:justify;">Laser vision correction is based on precise measurements of the imperfections in your vision. These measurements are taken with a powerful measurement tool known as the wave scan.</p>			
									</div>
								</dd>

								<dt id="service7"><i class="fa fa-check"></i>Is laser vision correction permanent?</dt>
								<dd style="display: none;">
									<div class="row">
										<p style="padding: 0 10px 0 10px; text-align:justify;">Yes, laser vision correction results in a permanent change to the shape of the cornea. However, laser vision correction will not prevent age related conditions such as presbyopia (the need for reading glases) or cataracts. These conditions would still be treated in their normal manner. If you are over 40, you may want to consider monovision.</p>			
									</div>
								</dd>
								<dt id="service8"><i class="fa fa-check"></i>Is laser vision correction safe?</dt>
								<dd style="display: none;">
									<div class="row">
										<p style="padding: 0 10px 0 10px; text-align:justify;">No surgical procedure is without risk. Serious complications with LASIK or LASEK are extremely rare. The chance of having a vision reduction complication is much less than one percent. Many of the risks and complications associated with these procedures can be eliminated or reduced through our careful patient selection as well as our thorough pre-operative testing with our state-of-the-art diagnostic equipment.</p>	
										<p style="padding: 0 10px 0 10px; text-align:justify;">You may experience some visual side effects after laser vision correction. These are usually mild and most often diminish a few days to a few weeks following your procedure. The most common side effects of laser vision correction are "halo" effect and some glare at night around lights. These are related to the area of treatment on the surface of the eye and the size of your pupil in dim lighting. However, these problems are no worse than what most contact lens and eyeglass wearers often experience.</p>		
									</div>
								</dd>
								<dt id="service9"><i class="fa fa-check"></i>Are all laser centers the same??</dt>
								<dd style="display: none;">
									<div class="row">
										<p style="padding: 0 10px 0 10px; text-align:justify;">No. Many of the discount laser centers feel that surgeon experience, type of laser, diagnostic technology and follow-up care doesn't matter. At SOUTH FLORIDA LASER EYE CENTER we want you to make your decision very carefully, not quickly, since it will affect the way you see for the rest of your life. LASIK/LASEK marketing can at times be misleading and knowing what to ask before moving forward can be of great benefit to all prospective patients. We will inform you of important considerations to help you know what to look for in a laser center. We feel the more you know about us, the more confident you will feel about choosing SOUTH FLORIDA LASER EYE CENTER to be your laser vision correction provider.</p>			
									</div>
								</dd>
								<dt id="service11"><i class="fa fa-check"></i>What are the long-term effects of laser vision correction? </dt>
								<dd style="display: none;">
									<div class="row">
										<p style="padding: 0 10px 0 10px; text-align:justify;">Laser vision correction has been performed since 1987. The FDA has approved the use of the excimer laser and recognized laser vision correction as being safe and effective for the treatment of nearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism in eligible patients.</p>			
									</div>
								</dd>
								<dt id="service12"><i class="fa fa-check"></i>What about night vision?</dt>
								<dd style="display: none;">
									<div class="row">
										<p style="padding: 0 10px 0 10px; text-align:justify;">There has been considerable news coverage about people having a difficult time driving at night after having laser vision correction. Night vision problems may include blurry vision, halos, starbursts and glare around the lights. Some of these can be caused by over-correction, under-correction or residual astigmatism. These effects usually diminish as the eye heals (in the first three to six months following the procedure). Pupil size is another cause of poor night vision. The pupil expands at night to allow more light to enter. If the pupil opens beyond the laser treatment area, the light may be blurry or out of focus. This is one of the reasons why some patients are not good candidates and also why pre-operative testing is so important. However, at South Florida Laser Eye Center, our advanced laser technology has expanded treatment zones, Patients that at one time were not candidates, can now be successfully treated.</p>			
									</div>
								</dd>
								<dt id="service13"><i class="fa fa-check"></i>Will LASIK/LASEK make my eyes dry?</dt>
								<dd style="display: none;">
									<div class="row">
										<p style="padding: 0 10px 0 10px; text-align:justify;">Most patients experience temporary dry eye immediately following a LASIK/LASEK procedure. Though these dry eye symptoms are less common after LASIK/LASEK procedure. Most often this is treated successfully with the use of artificial tears. The dry eye sensation usually clears up in eight to twelve weeks. In some cases, it may take longer. Patients with dry eye may not be good candidates for LASIK/LASEK, unless treated for this condition both before and after surgery. This should be discussed with Dr. Tavakkoli during your pre-op examination. </p>			
									</div>
								</dd>
								<dt id="service14"><i class="fa fa-check"></i>Will laser vision correction hurt?</dt>
								<dd style="display: none;">
									<div class="row">
										<p style="padding: 0 10px 0 10px; text-align:justify;">There is little or no discomfort during the procedures since anesthetic eye drops numb your eyes. Some patients may experience mild discomfort or a slight pressure sensation during their procedure. After LASIK/LASEK it is common to have some eye irritation the first few hours following your procedure. An over-the-counter pain medication or use of artificial tears will generally take care of this discomfort. Patients usually experience irritation for three to five days following their LASIK/LASEK.</p>			
									</div>
								</dd>
								<dt id="service15"><i class="fa fa-check"></i>What if I move my eye during my procedure?</dt>
								<dd style="display: none;">
									<div class="row">
										<p style="padding: 0 10px 0 10px; text-align:justify;">We use the most technologically advanced excimer laser that offers eye-tracking capabilities to continually reposition the laser beam during your procedure. The laser detects and then compensates for small movements by guiding the beam to keep it precisely centered over the treatment area.</p>			
									</div>
								</dd>
								<dt id="service16"><i class="fa fa-check"></i>Will both eyes be treated on the same day?</dt>
								<dd style="display: none;">
									<div class="row">
										<p style="padding: 0 10px 0 10px; text-align:justify;">For most procedures, both eyes will be treated on the same day.</p>			
									</div>
								</dd>
								<dt id="service17"><i class="fa fa-check"></i>How long does the procedure take?</dt>
								<dd style="display: none;">
									<div class="row">
										<p style="padding: 0 10px 0 10px; text-align:justify;">Since both eyes are usually treated during the same appointment, you will be in the laser suite for approximately 30 minutes. The surgery itself is typically less than two minutes per eye.</p>			
									</div>
								</dd>
								<dt id="service18"><i class="fa fa-check"></i>When can I return to work and normal activities?</dt>
								<dd style="display: none;">
									<div class="row">
										<p style="padding: 0 10px 0 10px; text-align:justify;">Most patients notice dramatic improvement within the first few days following the procedure and are able to drive a car and return to work within three days. Most LASIK patients see quite well within 48 hours. However, the speed of the visual recovery ultimately depends on personal healing patterns. With LASEK the recovery time may be a little longer.</p>			
									</div>
								</dd>
								<dt id="service19"><i class="fa fa-check"></i>What if I currently wear contact lenses?</dt>
								<dd style="display: none;">
									<div class="row">
										<p style="padding: 0 10px 0 10px; text-align:justify;">If you are wearing hard or gas permeable contacts it is important that you remove them at least four weeks prior to your exam. Soft lenses should be out for at least one week before your exam. It is important that the curvature of your eye returns to its natural shape. Dr. Tavakkoli will advise you how long you need to be out of your contacts prior to your procedure. If you are undergoing the Custom Vue Laser treatment, contact lenses should be out at least two weeks prior to your procedure to insure greater accuracy in your measurements.</p>			
									</div>
								</dd>
								<dt id="service20"><i class="fa fa-check"></i>How do I determine if I am a candidate for laser vision correction?</dt>
								<dd style="display: none;">
									<div class="row">
										<p style="padding: 0 10px 0 10px; text-align:justify;">Schedule a complimentary consultation with our office to determine if you are a good candidate. You need to be over 18 years of age, and your glasses or contact lens prescription should not have changed in the last year. If you are pregnant, nursing, or trying to conceive, you should not have laser vision correction at this time. Your complimentary consultation will take approximately 45 minutes and during this time we will determine candidacy.</p>			
									</div>
								</dd>
								<dt id="service21"><i class="fa fa-check"></i>Will my insurance cover laser vision correction?</dt>
								<dd style="display: none;">
									<div class="row">
										<p style="padding: 0 10px 0 10px; text-align:justify;">A few insurance companies do pay for all or part of vision correction procedures. You should check with your plan administrator, or we will be happy to make a copy of your insurance card and check coverage for you. Cafeteria or flex spending accounts are eligible for laser vision correction and can save you up to 50% by using pre-tax dollars.</p>			
									</div>
								</dd>
								<dt id="service21"><i class="fa fa-check"></i>Is there financing availible?</dt>
								<dd style="display: none;">
									<div class="row">
										<p style="padding: 0 10px 0 10px; text-align:justify;">Yes, we offer affordable payment plans and competitive pricing that makes laser vision correction easily affordable. It is easy to apply online and receive credit approval before you schedule your appointment.</p>			
									</div>
								</dd>
								<dt id="service21"><i class="fa fa-check"></i>What is a fair price for laser vision correction?</dt>
								<dd style="display: none;">
									<div class="row">
										<p style="padding: 0 10px 0 10px; text-align:justify;">The cost of vision correction varies among the practices and it is only natural to want to get the best price. At South Florida Laser Eye Center we pride ourselves in offering the latest technology with competitive prices. There are many factors that determine fee, such as surgeon experience, technology available, and what the center includes in the fee. </p>
